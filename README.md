## Reflection

**- What was the context for this project?**

After self-teaching ReactJS, I wanted a way to showcase various works and test my own knowledge. I decided that a front end website using React would be the best way to do this so I set out to create a simple, yet functional UI that represents my personal brand. The design is also fully mobile responsive and includes modern features such as scroll buttons and auto video playing.

**- What did I end up building?**

My final product is a fully hosted, secured website on the domain dylanslibrary.com. The website allows me to hold any projects I want using any technologies and display them elegantly in a fast, single page web application.

**- What tools did I use?**

For the functional development, TypeScript was used instead of JavaScript for stronger type support as well as Chakra UI as a design tool to speed up my work flow. Figma was used for initial mockups as well as Fontsource and LottieFiles for fonts and images.
